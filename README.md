[DockHero](http://addons.heroku.com/dockhero) hosts your Docker stack in AWS cloud.

Please request private alpha access at [dockhero.io](http://dockhero.io/)

Run any image from Docker Hub in our infrastructure, and attach it to your Heroku app as if it was a Heroku add-on.
Each docker image runs on a separate Amazon Web Services instance with a dedicated IP.
Your docker image logs will appear among your Heroku appâ€™s logs.

> callout
> The add-on is currently in private testing and available to the alpha testers only.
> Please email us at [dockhero@castle.co](mailto:dockhero@castle.co) to get access.

## Provisioning the add-on

DockHero can be attached to a Heroku application via the CLI:

> callout
> A list of all plans available can be found [here](http://addons.heroku.com/dockhero).

```term
$ heroku addons:create dockhero
-----> Adding dockhero to sharp-mountain-4005... done, v18 (free)
```

The actual provisioning may take up to 10 minutes. You can track the provisioning progress by logging into add-on dashboard:

```term
$ heroku addons:open dockhero
```

or using CLI plugin:

```term
$ heroku dh:wait  # requires CLI plugin installed - see below
```

Once DockHero has been added a `DOCKHERO_HOST` setting will be available in the app configuration and will contain the hostname of the newly provisioned Docker Swarm cluster (currently a single AWS EC2 instance). This can be confirmed using the `heroku config:get` command.

```term
$ heroku config:get DOCKHERO_HOST
orange-apple-1984.dockhero.io
```

## Installing CLI plugin

In order to access the newly provisioned Swarm cluster, install Dockhero CLI plugin:

```term
  heroku plugins:install dockhero
```

Now you can run docker / docker-compose against that cluster using the shortcuts below:

```term
  heroku dh:docker
  heroku dh:compose
```

Find other available commands in the [docs](https://github.com/cloudcastle/dockhero-cli)


## Preparing a stackfile

Use the following command to generate a sample stackfile:

```
$ heroku dh:install
Writing example stack into dockhero-compose.yml...
```

This will create  **dockhero-compose.yml** in the root of your repo.
It's recommended that you put this file under version control.
See [docker-compose.yml reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for the file syntax.
There are also [stackfile examples](https://github.com/cloudcastle/dockhero-docs/tree/master/examples) available for your reference.

In our example below, we'll be building a pluggable resource which returns message of the day via HTTP.
Here's a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockhero/motd-http/) which does that.

> callout
> You should already have Docker client set up locally.
> Please follow the [installation instructions for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)

First, replace `dockhero-compose.yml` content with the following:

```yml
web:
  image: dockhero/motd-http
  ports:
    - "80:8000"
```

Then run your stack:

```term
$ heroku dh:compose up -d
Creating network "dockhero_default" with driver "bridge"
Creating dockhero_web_1

$ heroku dh:compose ps
Name                  Command             State             Ports            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dockhero_web_1   /bin/sh -c http-server /app   Up      54.174.36.199:80->8080/tcp
```

Now you should be able to see a "Message Of The Day" by opening the app in your browser

```term
$ heroku dh:open
Opening http://orange-apple-1984.dockhero.io/...
```

## Using from Heroku app

In an application running on Heroku, you can fetch the host name of your Docker service from DOCKHERO_HOST environment variable. With the stack above has started, you can read the MOTD message using the following Ruby code:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'open-uri'
response = open("http://#{DOCKHERO_HOST}/") { |f| f.read }
puts "DOCKHERO says:\n  #{response}"
```

## Using SSL Endpoint

Each Dockhero cluster comes with two CloudFlare endpoints configured: one in *flexible ssl* mode and another in *full ssl* mode. They have valid SSL certificate installed, so that you don't need to purchase one yourself. Both endpoints are exposed to your Heroku environment:

```term
$ heroku config:get DOCKHERO_FLEXIBLE_SSL_URL
$ heroku config:get DOCKHERO_FULL_SSL_URL
```

SSL is terminated at the CloudFlare edge server, then the request is sent to Dockhero cluster via http:// or https:// protocol depending on SSL mode (flexible or full).

With Flexible SSL, you don't need to implement SSL in your stack at all.
![Flexible SSL](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206124658/cfssl_flexible.png)

With Full SSL, your stack still needs to talk SSL, but you can use a self-signed certificate. No worries, the users will see a valid CloudFlare's certificate - find more about CloudFlare SSL in [this article](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170416-What-do-the-SSL-options-mean-)
![Full SSL](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206167937/cfssl_full.png)


## Logging

DockHero activity can be identified within the Heroku log-stream by `dockhero` prefix:

```term
$ heroku logs -p dockhero
```

You can also attach to Docker's logs stream directly:

```
$ heroku dh:compose logs --follow
```

## Troubleshooting known issues

You can run your stack in foreground mode to simplify debugging.
Remember to pull updated images and pass `--build` and `--force-recreate` options
in order for changes to apply:

```term
$ heroku dh:compose pull
Pulling web (dockhero/dockhero-docs:hello)...
modern-fog-4352: Pulling dockhero/dockhero-docs:hello... : downloaded

$ heroku dh:compose up
Creating dockhero_web_1
Attaching to dockhero_web_1
web_1  | Starting up http-server, serving /app
web_1  | Available on:
web_1  |   http://127.0.0.1:8080
web_1  |   http://172.17.0.4:8080
web_1  | Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

> callout
> After stopping your stack (especially with Ctrl-C), remember to wait until
> it actually goes down and reports this in the console. It usually takes 5-20 seconds.

Sometimes you can't start the stack because the port is already taken:

```term
$ heroku dh:compose create --build --force-recreate
Recreating dockhero_web_1
ERROR: Cannot create container for service web:
  Unable to find a node that satisfies the following conditions
   [port 80 (Bridge mode)]
```

In this case you need to bring your stack down first.
NOTE: this will stop all the services and remove all you current containers

```term
$ heroku dh:compose down
Removing 48d9cb310fcb_dockhero_web_1 ... done
```


## Migrating between plans

Currently only the Test plan is supported

## Removing the add-on

DockHero can be removed via the CLI.

> warning
> This will destroy all associated data and cannot be undone!

```term
$ heroku addons:destroy dockhero
-----> Removing dockhero from sharp-mountain-4005... done, v20 (free)
```
